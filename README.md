## Mover Site

https://ethyl2.github.io/mover_site/

This page is from a Udacity project about using ajax requests to insert information
from APIs. A user enters an address in the form, and three events happen:

1. The background becomes a Google Street View image of that address.
2. Relevant articles from the New York Times API about the city and state are
displayed on the left of the page.
3. Relevant Wikipedia links about the city from the Wikipedia API are added, with the
articles' first paragraphs being displayed.
